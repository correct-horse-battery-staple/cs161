Stage 1: Single-cycle processor

Successfully implemented the following instructions:
a.	     add
b.	     lw
c.	     sw
d.	     jr
e.	     jal (the link is stored in register 7)
f.	     nor
g.	     nori
h.	     not
i.	     bleu
j.	     rolv
k.	     rorv

All control signals are declared in the Control file and are listed below with details of usage:
    memWrite - whether memory is written
    regWriteEnable- whether registers are written
    aluSrc - control line for mux into ALU, determines whether input to ALU is immediate or register value
    jjr - control line for mux into PC, based on whether a jump operation is a jr or a jal
    ja - control line for mux into PC, based on whether a jump operation is performed
    link - control line for mux into WD3 of register file, based on whether a jal operation is performed (functionally equivalent to ~jjr)
    memtoReg - control line for mux into WD3, based on whether ALU result or memory is read
    brancha - control line for mux into PC, based on whether a branch is performed
    alu0-4 - control line for ALU operations, determines what operation is output

There are three adders in this implementation: PC->PC+4, PC+4+imm->branch, and ALU.
